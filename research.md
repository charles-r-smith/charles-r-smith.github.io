    <strong>Abstract:</strong> We develop a simple model of the bank merger process to study the rise in bank concentration following the deregulation of bank branching in the Riegle-Neal Act of 1994. Motivated by the data where currently 10 (dominant) banks have over 55 percent of the U.S. deposit market share while the remaining over 4000 (fringe) banks cover the rest, we apply a dominant-fringe framework with a merger stage to model the rise in concentration following the change in regulation making interstate branching possible. We study the effect of the merger wave on competition, efficiency, and stability of the banking industry.

      Adverse Selection and Learning Incentives: Evidence from Canada’s Consent for Credit Limit Increase Regulations
    </a>

  <p style="margin-top: 5px;">
    <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper documents the impact of regulations that require lenders to garner consent for credit limit increases. Leveraging regulatory changes in the Canadian credit card market, we find that requiring consumer consent prior to a credit limit increase led to more adverse selection as measured by increased late payments, delinquency, and charge-offs. In response to these regulations, lenders decreased the size of credit limits increases, and counterintuitively, increased the frequency of credit limit increases. We develop a precautionary savings model with endogenous credit limits to study the role of learning and adverse selection in markets with incomplete information. We show that learning from acceptance decisions can rationalize our empirical results. Our model suggests that requiring consumer consent reduced lender profits but had negligible effects for consumers. Counterfactuals demonstrate that under higher interest rates, requiring consumer consent would decrease credit provision.
